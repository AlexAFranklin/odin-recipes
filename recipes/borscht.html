    <h2>Description</h2>
         <p>If you don’t know what is borscht, it is deep red coloured soup with cabbage, beets, potatoes, carrots, onion and garlic, and possibly beef and beans. Then served with sour cream and dill. Essentially, this beet borscht recipe is a <em>superfood and a meal in itself.</em> “Borscht”, “borsch”, “borsh” or “борщ” is a true classic soup every Ukrainian or Russian grew up eating almost weekly. It can be vegan, vegetarian; with beef, pork or even chicken. It truly depends what’s in your fridge that day. That’s how beet borscht soup came about – out of necessity and hunger.</p>
         <p><strong>Borscht</strong> soup tastes sweet and tangy. Earthy flavors of beets truly shine through in this soup. So this borscht recipe definitely tastes like beets. Because we add vinegar, you want it to taste slightly vinegary and sweet with a pinch of sugar and natural sweetness of veggies.</p>
