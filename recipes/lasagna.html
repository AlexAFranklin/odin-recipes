        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p> I’m sure everyone has their own favorite go-to lasagna 
                recipe, but I’d just like to offer that this really is 
                <strong>The Best Lasagna Ever.</strong> Growing up, my mom and her friends
                 used to make it for potlucks and gatherings, and part of 
                 its appeal is that <em>the ingredients used are totally basic;</em> 
                 you don’t have to hunt down fresh basil or buffalo mozzarella 
                 or Parmigiano-Reggiano or handmade sausage from an Italian
                  mama in old Napoli. Anyone can make this, anywhere, anytime.
                 And it’s the easiest thing in the world.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 lb ground beef</li>
                <li>1 lb bulk Italian sausage</li>
                <li>1/2 cup warm water</li>
                <li>1 cup sliced black olives</li>
                <li>1 pinch basil</li>
                <li>2 tsp garlic powder</li>
                <li>1 tbsp dried oregano</li>
                <li>1 1/2 tsp dried sage</li>
                <li>2 tbsp minced garlic</li>
                <li>1 tbsp dried onion flakes</li>
                <li>2 (14 oz) jars marinara sauce</li>
                <li>1 (16 oz) package lasagna noodles</li>
                <li>8 oz ricotta cheese</li>
                <li>1 lb mozzarella cheese, shredded</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Brown the ground beef and Italian sausage in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Drain excess grease. Stir in the water and black olives, and season with basil, garlic powder, oregano, sage, pepper, minced garlic, and onion flakes. Simmer for about 15 minutes, stirring frequently. Stir in the marinara sauce, and remove from the heat.</li>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
                <li>Place a layer of the meat and sauce in the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish. Cover with a layer of dry noodles. Spread a thin layer of ricotta cheese over the noodles, and sprinkle with a little mozzarella cheese. Cover with another layer of sauce, and repeat layering ending with the meat and sauce on top. Reserve about 1/2 cup of mozzarella cheese for later.</li>
                <li>Bake for 45 minutes in the preheated oven, but check after 30 minutes depending on how thick the lasagna is. Lasagna is cooked when you can easily stick a knife into it. Sprinkle the reserved cheese over the top, and return to the oven for about 10 minutes for a nice melted cheese topping.</li>
