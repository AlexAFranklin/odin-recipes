# odin-recipes
I am building a basic recipe website. 
I will demonstrate the HTML skills I have aquired. This includes the use of paragraphs, headings, strong and em tags, as well as how to create unordered and ordered lists. I will also include links and images. 
I will also demonstrate my basic knowledge of Git and GitHub. This includes creating a repository on GitHub, copying a repository onto my local machine from GitHub, how to stage and commit files, how to write a proper commit message, and how to push my changes to my repository on GitHub.
